    <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Ava Khosravani</strong>, a Business Economics student at York University in Canada.</p>

    <p>I'm passionate about <strong>marketing, creativity</strong>, and building strong connections with people. Over the past few years, I've gained experience in <strong>customer service, sales, and team management</strong> â€” both in Iran and in Canada.</p>

    <p>I'm also skilled in <strong>public speaking</strong>, <strong>event organizing</strong>, and I enjoy working with diverse teams. Whether I'm planning a marketing campaign or helping customers, I always give my best with energy and care.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I love listening to music, spending time outdoors, and learning new skills that help me grow both personally and professionally.</p>
